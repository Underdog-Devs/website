              Incarceration rates in the U.S. began increasing dramatically in
              the 1990s. The U.S. has the highest prison population of any
              country, comprising 25% of the worldâ€™s prisoners.{' '}

              Out of a sample of 401,288 prisoners state prisoners released in

              Using this study as a basepoint, one could state that the national
              recidivism rate is 83%.

            <p>
              According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
              (BJS), 67.8% of released state prisoners were arrested for a new
              crime within three years, and 76.7% were arrested within five
              years (Durose, Cooper, & Snyder, 2014).

              Reducing recidivism not only protects society at large, but also
              improves the life quality of individual ex-prisoners.

            <p>
              Employment has long been recognized as having a negative
              correlation with crime (Uggen, 1999; Uggen et al., 2005).

              Researchers also have found that employment is associated with
              reduced recidivism(Skardhamar & Telle, 2012). The strongest
              predictor for recidivism: poverty + unemployment.
